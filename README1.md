CRUDDY GIFTS

CRUDDY GIFTS is an application that helps you keep track of all the gifts you have given, as well as received. With CRUDDY GIFTS, you can log gifts you have given by typing in who you want to give the gift to and selecting what item. If the person you are giving a gift to is not yet in the database, you can quickly add them by just typing in their name. If the gift receiver wants to join the app, they can just log in using their name and quickly set up their profile. Once successfully logged in, they will be able to also see what gifts you have given them. 

Never again have that akward moment of giving someone the same gift twice. With CRUDDY GIFTS we keep track for you.

Once logged in, you can view the gift shop of items available to give to someone. You can search the entire item database or narrow it down by price, category, or the name. You can also see any of your friends upcoming birthdays (within 3 months) so you don't forget to get them a gift. 

You can also look at your gift profile. The gift profile gives you access to all the gifts you have given, received and a list of all your friends (friends are anyone you have had an interaction with, whether receiving/giving gift). 

Helpful Tips:
If you foget your login password, after 3 attempts to log in you will be prompted to reset your password. You must fill out the correct birthdate to verify that it is you.
